\section{Magnetic Mode Suppression in Red Clump Stars}
\begin{itemize}
\item RGB 
\item Clump
\item Possible scenarios for the He-flash
\item Constrains on dynamo theory
\end{itemize}

The understanding of magnetic mode suppression presented in Section \ref{rgb} can be used to make predictions for magnetic mode suppression in red clump stars. We expect that mode suppression will occur if strong fields created by convective core dynamos can exist within the radiative regions of clump stars. 

Figures \ref{fig:ClumpProp} and \ref{fig:ClumpPropMassive} show propagation diagrams of clump stars with ZAMS masses of $1.5 \, M_\odot$ and $2.5 \, M_\odot$, respectively. The stellar models have been computed using the MESA stellar evolution code
