\subsection{Incidence Rate of Strong Magnetic Fields in Red Giant Stars}
Stello et al. 2015 determined the incidence of strong internal magnetic fields as function of stellar mass in red giants. Stars that did not have convective cores during the MS ($M<1.1\mso$) do not show suppressed dipole modes, while red giants with $1.1 \, M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim 1.5 \, M_\odot$ exhibit an increasing incidence in mode suppression rate with mass. In Section \ref{rgb} we discussed how the extension of the MS convective core could create this ramp up. However, this does not explain why the incidence rate of depressed dipole modes saturates at 50-60\% in red giants with $M \gtrsim 1.5 \mso$.

One possibility is that there is a range of efficiencies in converting kinetic energy density into magnetic energy density in the convective cores of intermediate mass stars. This could be due, for example, to a distribution of core rotation rates during the MS. Stars with relatively rapidly rotating convective cores (small Rossby numbers) would result in efficient dynamo action, while stars with slowly rotating cores might not produce strong and/or stable internal magnetic fields. For this to work, there should be a large population of MS A-type stars rotating with periods similar to or larger than the convective turnover timescale. The latter is on the order of a month, whereas the observed typical surface rotation periods of A stars is a few days \citep{Zorec_2012}
%with  asteroseismology indicating that these stars are likely to rotate almost rigidly during the MS \citep[e.g.][]{Benomar_2015}.
Therefore this scenario seems unlikely, unless stars in the $1.1$-$1.4 \, M_\odot$ range can be magnetically braked to rotation periods of weeks or longer before the end of the MS.

Another option is that, at the end of the main sequence and its associated contemporary dynamo, the magnetic field is able to evolve into a stable configuration only in 50-60\% of the cases. The evolution of magnetic fields into stable magnetic configurations has been studied \citep{Braithwaite_2006}, but it is difficult to make detailed predictions as the outcome depends on the complex initial conditions of the magnetic configuration left by turbulent convection, in particular magnetic energy and magnetic helicity \citep{Braithwaite_2008}. Moreover these theoretical calculations do not include a compositional stratification, which instead might play an important role in confining the magnetic field evolution once dynamo action ceases in the convective cores of stars.
