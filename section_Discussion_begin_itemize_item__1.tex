\subsection{Incidence Rate of Strong Magnetic Fields in Red Giant Stars}
Stello et al. 2015 have shown the incidence of strong internal magnetic fields as function of stellar mass in red giants. Stars that did not have convective cores during the main sequence ($M<1.1\mso$) do not show depressed mixed modes, while red giants with mass above this limit indicates a gradually increasing incidence rate of strong internal magnetism.    In Sec.~\ref{rgb} we have discussed the extension of the hydrogen convective core as a possible reason for this slow ramp up. However this does not explain why the incidence rate of depressed mixed modes only reaches 50-60\% in red giants with mass around $2\mso$.
A possibility is that there is a range of efficiencies in converting kinetic energy density into magnetic energy density in the convective cores of intermediate mass stars. This could be due, for example, to a distribution of rotation rates during the main sequence. Stars with relatively rapidly rotating convective cores (small Rossby numbers) would result in efficient dynamo action, while stars with slow-rotating cores might not produce strong magnetic fields. Note that these stars  might still have fairly high magnetic fields in their cores, but below the threshold of activation for the magnetic greenhouse effect.

Another option is that, at the end of the main sequence and its associated contemporary dynamo, the magnetic field is able to arrange into a stable configuration only in a 50-60\% of the cases. The evolution into stable magnetic configurations has been studied, in the absence of a compositional stratification, by  and it seems to be depending on
