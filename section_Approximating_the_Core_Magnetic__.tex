\section{Approximating the Core Magnetic Field Strength}

A rough estimate for the core magnetic field strength of a star with a convective MS core can be calculated as follows. The MS luminosity is efficiently carried by core convective motions, and implies an equipartition field strength of 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Beq2}
B_{\rm eq} \simeq (4 \pi \rho)^{1/6} L^{1/3} r^{-2/3} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we have used $v_{\rm con} \simeq \big[L/(4 \pi \rho r^2)\big]^{1/3}$ to rewrite equation \ref{eqn:Beq}, and $L$ is the stellar luminosity. In general, this expression is a function of radius. At the edge of the convective core, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:rc}
r_{\rm c} = \bigg[ \frac{3 M_{\rm c}}{4 \pi {\bar \rho}_{\rm c}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $M_{\rm c}$ is the mass of the convective core and ${\bar \rho}_{\rm c}$ is its average density.
