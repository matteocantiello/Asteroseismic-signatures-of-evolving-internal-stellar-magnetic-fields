\section{Approximating the Core Magnetic Field Strength}

A rough estimate for the core magnetic field strength of a star with a convective MS core can be calculated as follows. The MS luminosity is efficiently carried by core convection motions, and implies an equipartition field strength of 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Beq2}
B_{\rm eq} \simeq (4 \pi \rho)^{1/6} L^{1/3} r^{-2/3} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we have used $v_{\rm con} \simeq \big[L/(4 \pi \rho r^2)\big]^{1/3}$ to rewrite equation \ref{eqn:Beq}.
