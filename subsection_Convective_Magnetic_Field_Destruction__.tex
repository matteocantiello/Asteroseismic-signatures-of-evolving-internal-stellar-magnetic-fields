\subsection{Convective Magnetic Field Destruction}

The predictions outlined above assumed that magnetic fields generated by core dynamos during the MS are preserved through red giant evolution. While this is likely a good assumption for magnetic fields in radiative regions (see Section \ref{time}), it may not hold in regions of the star that become convective during post-MS evolution. In fact, convection may destroy dynamo-generated fields during later phases of evolution, especially if the newly formed convective regions are slowly rotating (as measured in many red giant cores, \cite{Mosser_2012}), such that a large scale dynamo does not operate.

We emphasize that it is not clear whether convection will destroy pre-existing stable field configurations. If the convective energy density, $\epsilon_{\rm con}$, is larger than the magnetic energy density, $\epsilon_{\rm mag}$, the convective motions may not be constrained by the magnetic fields. In this case, the convection could scramble the pre-existing field into an unstable configuration. In the case where $\epsilon_{\rm con} < \epsilon_{\rm mag}$, convective motions could be confined along the field lines, such that the field remains nearly unaltered. Nonetheless, the convective diffusivity may still be able to erode the stable fields on relatively short timescales.

There are three convective phases during red giant evolution that may destroy MS dynamo-generated fields. First, the convective envelope can extend below mass coordinates of $\approx 0.3 \, M_\odot$ (see Figure \ref{fig:DipoleHistConv}) during the first dredge-up when the star ascends the RGB. In these regions, we find that $\epsilon_{\rm con} > \epsilon_{\rm mag}$, evaluating $\epsilon_{\rm mag}$ using equations \ref{eqn:Beq} and \ref{eqn:Brgb}. It is therefore possible that any fields at mass coordinates above the deepest extent of the convective envelope are destroyed.

Second, very vigorous convection develops during He flashes in stars of $M \lesssim 2 \, M_\odot$. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm con} \gg \epsilon_{\rm mag}$ during He flashes, such that the short-lived convection can likely destroy pre-existing fields. Figure~\ref{fig:DipoleHistConv} shows that these flashes induce convection in all mass coordinates below $ \sim \! 0.4 \, M_\odot$ in low-mass stars. We find that stars with $M \lesssim 2.1 \, M_\odot$ have evolved such that {\it all} mass coordinates  of the radiative core on the clump were convective at some point of prior red giant evolution. 

Third, the He-burning convective core in clump stars could consume fields within this region. This process is not necessarily relevant for dipole mode suppression, which relies on strong magnetic fields within radiative regions. However, if destruction of the field within the convective core destabilizes the field in overlying radiative regions, core convection could still have an impact. We find that $\epsilon_{\rm con} \sim \epsilon_{\rm mag}$ within the convective cores of our stellar models on the clump. Thus, it is not clear whether MS dynamo-generated fields will be destroyed during core He burning. 

The discussion above allows for a prediction about the occurrence of magnetic mode suppression in clump stars. If convection in red giants destroys previously existing fields, we expect dipole mode suppression to only occur in relatively massive $M \gtrsim 2.1 \, M_\odot$ secondary clump stars. Only these massive stars contain radiative regions that were convective on the MS (and may contain strong dynamo-generated fields) but which were not convective during prior evolution on the RGB or during He flashes. 

The observation (or lack thereof) of dipole mode suppression in clump stars will therefore provide great understanding of magnetic field evolution in stellar interiors. If mode suppression is common in stars with masses as small as $\sim \! 1.5 \, M_\odot$, this would indicate that magnetic fields are robust, and are able to survive through post-MS convective phases. If mode suppression only occurs in stars with $M \gtrsim 2.1 \, M_\odot$, this would indicate that post-MS convection generally destroys pre-existing fields. 

We caution that these results can be somewhat influenced by the size of the convective core, which may not be accurately calculated by stellar evolution codes such as MESA  because of mixing induced by convective overshoot. Indeed, asteroseismic studies of clump stars (\cite{montalban_2013,stello_2013,mosser_2014,bossini_2015,constantino_2015}) and sub-dwarf B stars \citep{vangrootel_2010a,vangrootel_2010b,charpinet_2011,Schindler_2015} indicate that the convective core is somewhat larger than predicted by stellar evolution codes, even using optimistic overshooting prescriptions. MS convective cores may also be somewhat larger and show evidence for enhanced mixing \citep{moravveji_2015}.  Our calculations of mode visibilities and field strengths $B_c$ are not strongly affected, but inferences based on the extent of the convective core become less certain.
%In particular, the large convective core masses inferred for clump/sdB stars may contribute to lower dipole mode suppression rates in these stars if
