\subsection{Magnetic Field Structure}
\label{fieldstruc}

The spatial structure of a main sequence dynamo-generated field has important implications for the suppression of oscillation modes during the red giant phase. As discussed above, the radial extent of the field will effect the mass range over which the magnetic greenhouse effect is likely to occur.

The angular structure of the field will also affect the processes of magnetic suppression and magnetic mode splitting, which could potentially be used to constrain the magnetic field structure within red giants.
