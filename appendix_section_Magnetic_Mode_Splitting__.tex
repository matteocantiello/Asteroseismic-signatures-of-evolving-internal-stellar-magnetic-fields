\section{Magnetic Mode Splitting}
\label{magmode}

Here we provide an approximate formula to estimate the magnitude of magnetic splitting from equation \ref{eqn:dommag}. To simplify the calculation, we adopt an unphysical scenario of a magnetic field purely in the radial direction. In this scenario the splitting is independent of $m$, the more realistic case of a dipolar field is treated in \cite{Unno_1989} (but beware of typos in equation 19.65), and can produce different splittings for different $m$ modes depending on the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes.

For a radially symmetric field, equation \ref{eqn:dB} reduces to 
\begin{equation}
\delta
\end{equation}
