\section{Propagation Diagrams}

It is informative to understand the approximate magnetic field strengths $B_c$ needed for dipole mode alteration in various types of stars observed to pulsate in g modes. Here, we present propagation diagrams for three types of g mode pulsators: sdB stars, $\gamma$-Dor stars, and slowly pulsating B stars.
