\subsection{Operation of Main-Sequence Dynamo}
The main sequence of stars more massive than about 1.1$\mso$ is characterized by the presence of a convective core.
This is due to the activation of the CNO cycle, characterized by a reaction rate that depends more steeply on temperature than the p-p chain ($\epsilon_{\rm pp}\propto \rho T^{4}$, while $\epsilon_{\rm CNO}\propto \rho T^{18}$ ).
