\label{fig:timescales}
Ohmic diffusion timescale, $t_{\rm Ohm}$, and mass accretion timescale onto the helium core, $t_{\rm Acc}$, for a $1.5 \, M_\odot$ stellar model evolving from the MS up the RGB. At all phases of evolution and at all radii, $t_{\rm Ohm} \gg t_{\rm Acc}$, and so a core-dynamo-generated magnetic field is unable to significantly diffuse outward during the MS or RGB.
