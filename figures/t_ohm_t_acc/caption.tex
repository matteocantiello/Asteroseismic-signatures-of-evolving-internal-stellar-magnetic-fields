\label{fig:timescales}
Ohmic diffusion timescale, $t_{\rm Ohm}$, and mass accretion timescale onto the helium core, $t_{\rm Acc}$, for a $1.5 \, M_\odot$ stellar model evolving from the MS up the RGB. The plot shows values of the timescales in the inner $0.6 M_\odot$ of the model. The evolutionary stages for which the profiles are extracted are identified by the colored dots on the evolutionary track (see the inset). At all phases of evolution and at all radii, $t_{\rm Ohm} \gg t_{\rm Acc}$, and so a core-dynamo-generated magnetic field is unable to significantly diffuse outward during the MS or RGB.
