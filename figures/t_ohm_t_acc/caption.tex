\label{fig:timescales}
Ohmic diffusion timescale, $t_{\rm Ohm}$, and mass accretion timescale onto the helium core, $t_{\rm Acc}$, for a $1.5 \, M_\odot$ stellar model evolving from the MS up the RGB. Values are shown for the inner $0.55 \, M_\odot$ of the model. The evolutionary stages for which the profiles are extracted are identified by the colored dots on the evolutionary track (see the inset). The accretion timescale can only be calculated after the end of the MS, when a Helium core is present. At all phases of evolution and at all radii, $t_{\rm Ohm} \gg t_{\rm Acc}$, and so a core dynamo-generated magnetic field is unable to significantly diffuse outward during the MS or RGB.
