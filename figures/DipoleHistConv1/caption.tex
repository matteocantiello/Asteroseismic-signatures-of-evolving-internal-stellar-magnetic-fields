\label{fig:DipoleHistConv}
Same as Figure \ref{fig:DipoleHist}, but we have also marked regions that are convective during the RGB evolution (green hatched areas) and regions that are convective during He shell flashes and/or He core burning (orange hatched regions). If convection during RGB/clump evolution destroys strong magnetic fields created during the main sequence, we should not expect magnetic suppression to occur in stars that undergo He shell flashes, i.e., stars of $M \lesssim 2.1 \, M_\odot$. However, magnetic suppression may still be possible in secondary clump stars, i.e., stars of $M \gtrsim 2.1 \, M_\odot$.
