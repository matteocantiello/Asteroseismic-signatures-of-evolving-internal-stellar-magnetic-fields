\label{fig:WDProp}
Same as Figure \ref{fig:sdBprop}, but for the outer layers of a model of a ZZ-ceti star. The model has $M=0.6\,M_\odot$ and $T_{\rm eff} = 12000 \, {\rm K}$. We have added a dipole magnetic field with a surface field strength of $10^7 \, {\rm G}$. In this model, field strengths in excess of $\sim 10^4 \, {\rm G}$ are likely sufficient to suppress or modify typical WD g mode pulsations with periods of $\sim$minutes.
