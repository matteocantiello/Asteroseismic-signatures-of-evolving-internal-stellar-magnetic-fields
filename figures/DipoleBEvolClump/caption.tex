\label{fig:BcClump}
Critical field strength $B_c$ required for magnetic suppression on the clump. The tracks extend from just after the onset of core He burning to core He exhaustion. Low-mass stars ($M<2.0 \, M_\odot$) begin clump evolution at the base of the tracks and evolve toward larger values of $B_c$ as the value of $N$ at the H-burning shell decreases. Higher mass stars ($M>2.0 \, M_\odot$) begin at the right-hand side of the tracks and evolve toward the left as the envelope expands and the value of $\nu_{\rm max}$ decreases.
