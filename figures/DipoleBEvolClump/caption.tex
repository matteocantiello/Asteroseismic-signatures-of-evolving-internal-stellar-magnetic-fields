\label{fig:BcClump}
Critical field strength $B_c$ required for magnetic suppression on the clump. The tracks are plotted during core He-burning when the central mass fraction of He is $0.05 < Y < 0.9$. Low-mass stars ($M<2.0 \, M_\odot$) begin clump evolution at the bottom of the tracks and evolve counter-clockwise along the tracks. Higher mass stars ($M>2.0 \, M_\odot$) begin at the right-hand side of the tracks and evolve toward the left as the stellar envelope expands and the value of $\nu_{\rm max}$ decreases.
