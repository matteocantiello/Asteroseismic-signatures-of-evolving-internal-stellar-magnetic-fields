\label{fig:GdorProp}
Same as Figure \ref{fig:sdBProp}, but for a model of a $\gamma$-Dor star. This model has $M=1.6 \, M_\odot$ and $T_{\rm eff} = 6700 \, K$. The horizontal black line indicates the frequency $\nu_{\rm g}$ of a typical $\gamma$-Dor mode. The sharp dip in $B_c$ just outside the convective core is created by the sharp peak in $N^2$ due to composition gradients at the core boundary. This value is sensitive to mixing and overshoot prescriptions and is not reliable.
