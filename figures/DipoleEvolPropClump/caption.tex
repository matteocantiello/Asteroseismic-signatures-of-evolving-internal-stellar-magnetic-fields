Propagation diagram for $1.5 \, M_\odot$ model on the clump. The magnetized areas (green regions) correspond to stably stratified regions which supported a convective dynamo on the main sequence. The field strength is calculated assuming magnetic flux conservation from equipartition fields generated via a main-sequence dynamo.
