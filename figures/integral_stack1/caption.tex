\label{fig:visibility} Bands of visibility for suppressed $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ modes as a function of $\nu_{\rm max}$ for stars of different initial mass during H-shell burning (RGB, left panel) and during He-core burning (Clump, right panel). The upper and lower boundaries for the visibility bands correspond to values of $\tau$ 5 and 20 days, consistent with \citet{Dupret_200,Corsaro_2015}.
