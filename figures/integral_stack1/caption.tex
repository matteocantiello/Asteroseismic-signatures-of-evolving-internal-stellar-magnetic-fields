\label{fig:visibility} Bands of visibility for suppressed $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ modes as a function of $\nu_{\rm max}$ for stars of different initial mass during H-shell burning (green/blue bands) and during He-core burning (Clump, red/orange bands). The upper and lower boundaries for the visibility bands correspond to values of radial mode lifetime $\tau=$ 10 and 30 days respectively, consistent with \citet{Dupret_2009,Corsaro_2015}. The right panel is a zoom of the left panel near the clump. Red giant branch calculations are shown after H central mass fraction is $ X < 0.001$ and before the star reaches the tip of the RGB. Clump models are shown when the central mass fraction of He is $0.05 < Y < 0.9$.
