\label{fig:visibility} Bands of visibility for suppressed $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ modes as a function of $\nu_{\rm max}$ for stars of different initial mass during H-shell burning (RGB, left panel) and during He-core burning (Clump, right panel). The upper and lower boundaries for the visibility bands correspond to values of modes envelope life-time $\tau=$ 5 and 20 days respectively, consistent with \cite{Dupret_2009,Corsaro_2015}.
